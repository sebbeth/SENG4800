This is the Unreal Engine project that is set up to be the base of our project.

This is a C++ project setup for version 1.19.3 of Unreal Engine 4

Visual Studio must be installed for this project to compile.

# Project Setup:

Pull the project down from GitHub.

Install Unreal Engine version 4.19.* preferably 4.19.2 (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/Installation)

Install Visual Studio 2017, community version is fine.

When VS is installed, add the following packages to it using VS Installer

After all these packages are installed, Open the project, you will be prompted to recompile the project, if you have installed the required packages successfully it will work from here and you will be able to edit the project, if there were errors it will probably fail to compile.

Once the project is open you can access c++ files in VS and modify them there.
